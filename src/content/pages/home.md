feature_description1:
  We look forward to welcoming delegates from far and near. We
  firmly believe that when the Bible is opened and taught faithfully
  and relevantly the voice of God is heard in a living and powerful
  way. We therefore seek to encourage those engaged in preaching to
  see the expounding of Scripture as the pressing need in
  today&apos;s church and help equip them in the exacting work
  involved in such a ministry.
feature_description2:
  While the assembly, therefore, is mainly for those in current
  full-time preaching ministries, others are welcome, especially
  students and spouses of Christian workers.


  As well as the annual assembly the Steering Group are seeking
  other means by which they might encourage this task such as
  helping to support other conferences and running preaching
  conferences.

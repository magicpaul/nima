hero_description: 'The aim of the Northern Ireland Ministry Assembly is to encourage and help preachers to give themselves to the indispensable work of presenting the Lord Jesus Christ to believers and unbelievers, to all ages, and to all kinds of people. We seek to encourage a commitment to expository preaching that will fill our churches with a hunger for God and his Word and lead to a new desire for mission.'

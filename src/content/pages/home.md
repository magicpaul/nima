feature_description1: We firmly believe that when the Bible is taught faithfully and relevantly the voice of God is heard in a living and powerful way. We therefore seek to encourage those engaged in a preaching ministry to see the expounding of Scripture as the pressing need in todayâ€™s church and aim to equip them for this exacting task.
feature_description2:
  The annual two-day Ministry Assembly in November at Maze Presbyterian Church, which Is fully-catered, is slanted towards those in full-time preaching ministries but Bible students and spouses of Gospel workers are very welcome.

  NIMA partners with Cornhill Belfast to hold a Preaching Day in May. This is a one-day uncatered event which is open to anyone who is involved in teaching the Bible.

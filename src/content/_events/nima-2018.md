directions: "How to get there: From the M1 take the Sprucefield exit and follow
  the signs for Hillsborough/Dublin/Newry onto the A1 dual carriageway. After 1
  mile and at the top of the hill you will see a sign pointing right for
  Culcavy. This road is Harrys Road. Travel for 1 mile, go straight across the
  crossroads, and onto Aghnatrisk Road, which again is 1 mile long. At this
  crossroads turn right – past houses and a Methodist church. Once over the
  motorway bridge the Church is on the left – in total it's just over 3 miles
  from Sprucefield."

The aim of our annual assembly is to encourage preachers. We firmly believe that when the Bible is opened and taught faithfully and relevantly the voice of God is heard in a living and powerful way. We therefore seek to encourage those engaged in preaching to see the exacting work of expounding Scripture as the pressing need in today's church. While the assembly, therefore, is mainly for those in current full-time preaching ministries, others are very welcome, especially students, apprentices and spouses of Christian workers.

Luke tells us that he wanted to provide an orderly account of the life of Jesus that would help people be more certain of the good news of God's salvation. So how do we preach this Gospel as Luke intended? How does Luke organise his material? How does it all fit together? What’s this Gospel about? And what are the tools we need to preach it faithfully? David and William will feed and encourage us from God’s Word and equip us to be servants of this Word in our ministries.

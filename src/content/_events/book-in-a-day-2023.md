The day is suitable for Bible readers (all of us) and - especially - Bible teachers of all kinds. Engage with 2 Peter and discover how it speaks to us today.

The aim of this day is to encourage and help those involved in ministering God's Word give themselves to the indispensable work of presenting the Lord Jesus Christ to believers and unbelievers, to all ages, and to all kinds of people. We want to encourage a fresh commitment to expository preaching that will fill our churches with a hunger for God and his Word and lead to a new desire for mission

We are looking forward to welcoming: Rupert Bentley Taylor

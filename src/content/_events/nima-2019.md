directions: "How to get there: From the M1 take the Sprucefield exit and follow the signs for Hillsborough/Dublin/Newry onto the A1 dual carriageway. After 1 mile and at the top of the hill you will see a sign pointing right for Culcavy. This road is Harrys Road. Travel for 1 mile, go straight across the crossroads, and onto Aghnatrisk Road, which again is 1 mile long. At this crossroads turn right – past houses and a Methodist church. Once over the motorway bridge the Church is on the left – in total it's just over 3 miles from Sprucefield."

### The Fourteenth Northern Ireland Ministry Assembly

The aim of our annual assembly is to encourage preachers. We firmly believe that when the Bible is opened and taught faithfully and relevantly the voice of God is heard in a living and powerful way. We therefore seek to encourage those engaged in preaching to see the exacting work of expounding Scripture as the pressing need in today's church. While the assembly, therefore, is mainly for those in current full-time preaching ministries, others are very welcome, especially students, apprentices and spouses of Christian workers.

  The aim of our assembly is to encourage and help preachers to give themselves to the indispensable work of presenting the Lord Jesus Christ to believers and unbelievers, to all ages, and to all kinds of people. We want to encourage a fresh commitment to expository preaching that will fill our churches with a hunger for God and his Word and lead to a new desire for mission.

  How to get there: From the M1 take the Sprucefield exit and follow the signs for Hillsborough/Dublin/Newry onto the A1 dual carriageway. After 1 mile and at the top of the hill you will see a sign pointing right for Culcavy. This road is Harrys Road. Travel for 1 mile, go straight across the crossroads, and onto Aghnatrisk Road, which again is 1 mile long. At this crossroads turn right – past houses and a Methodist church. Once over the motorway bridge the Church is on the left – in total it's just over 3 miles from Sprucefield.

The aim of our assembly is to encourage and help preachers to give
themselves to the indispensable work of presenting the Lord Jesus
Christ to believers and unbelievers, to all ages, and to all kinds
of people. We want to encourage a fresh commitment to expository
preaching that will fill our churches with a hunger for God and his
Word and lead to a new desire for mission.

We look forward to welcoming delegates from far and near. We firmly
believe that when the Bible is opened and taught faithfully and
relevantly the voice of God is heard in a living and powerful way.
We, therefore, seek to encourage those engaged in preaching to see
the expounding of Scripture as the pressing need in today&apos;s
church and help equip them in the exacting work involved in such a
ministry. While the assembly, therefore, is mainly for those in
current full-time preaching ministries, others are welcome,
especially students, interns, and spouses of Christian workers

We are looking forward to welcoming: Dan Doriani &amp; David Gibson

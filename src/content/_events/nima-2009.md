### The Fourth Northern Ireland Ministry Assembly

Preaching the Word of God is always a challenge.

But how can we preach into the post-Christian culture of the 21st century and still be true to God's written Word?

Hugh Palmer believes that Paul in 1 Thessalonians will help us make our preaching connect and in four talks will introduce us to the contemporary nature of the apostle's message.

From the Book of Acts and 2 Peter, Voddie Baucham will demonstrate how the apostolic message effectively engaged with the pagan cultures and worldviews of its day. He will also show that preaching this same message today is still God's way of revealing the truth of the Gospel to a post-Christian secular society.

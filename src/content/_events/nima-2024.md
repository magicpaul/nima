directions: "How to get there: From the M1 take the Sprucefield exit and follow
  the signs for Hillsborough/Dublin/Newry onto the A1 dual carriageway. After 1
  mile and at the top of the hill you will see a sign pointing right for
  Culcavy. This road is Harrys Road. Travel for 1 mile, go straight across the
  crossroads, and onto Aghnatrisk Road, which again is 1 mile long. At this
  crossroads turn right – past houses and a Methodist church. Once over the
  motorway bridge the Church is on the left – in total it's just over 3 miles
  from Sprucefield."

The aim of our assembly is to encourage Bible teachers and Bible sharers to give themselves to the indispensable work of presenting the Lord Jesus Christ to believers and unbelievers, to all ages, and to all kinds of people. We, therefore, seek to help those engaged in preaching and teaching to see the expounding of Scripture as the pressing need in today's church and to equip them in the exacting work involved in such a ministry. While the assembly, therefore, is mainly for those in full-time preaching ministries, others are welcome, especially students, interns, and spouses of Christian workers.

When the Jewish exiles returned from Babylon those among them who remembered the splendour of Solomon’s temple saw, in the rebuilding of the new sanctuary, their dreams of the kingdom being restored to its former glory shrink in what was, for them, a day of small things.

It is not difficult to see the parallels given that we, too, live in a time where places of worship that were once full are now empty and where things are at a low ebb in both the worship and witness of the church. This is where the message of the post-exilic prophets to God’s people then have a particular relevance to God’s people now and we look forward to exploring their message and application.

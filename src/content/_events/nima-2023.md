directions: "How to get there: From the M1 take the Sprucefield exit and follow
  the signs for Hillsborough/Dublin/Newry onto the A1 dual carriageway. After 1
  mile and at the top of the hill you will see a sign pointing right for
  Culcavy. This road is Harrys Road. Travel for 1 mile, go straight across the
  crossroads, and onto Aghnatrisk Road, which again is 1 mile long. At this
  crossroads turn right – past houses and a Methodist church. Once over the
  motorway bridge the Church is on the left – in total it's just over 3 miles
  from Sprucefield."

The aim of our assembly is to encourage and help preachers to give themselves to the indispensable work of presenting the Lord Jesus Christ to believers and unbelievers, to all ages, and to all kinds of people. We want to encourage a fresh commitment to expository preaching that will fill our churches with a hunger for God and his Word and lead to a new desire for mission.

We look forward to welcoming delegates from far and near. We firmly believe that when the Bible is opened and taught faithfully and relevantly the voice of God is heard in a living and powerful way. We, therefore, seek to encourage those engaged in preaching to see the expounding of Scripture as the pressing need in today's church and help equip them in the exacting work involved in such a ministry. While the assembly, therefore, is mainly for those in current full-time preaching ministries, others are welcome, especially students, interns, and spouses of Christian workers

We are looking forward to welcoming Sam Alberry and Andy Prime.

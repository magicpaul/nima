directions: "How to get there: From the M1 take the Sprucefield exit and follow
  the signs for Hillsborough/Dublin/Newry onto the A1 dual carriageway. After 1
  mile and at the top of the hill you will see a sign pointing right for
  Culcavy. This road is Harrys Road. Travel for 1 mile, go straight across the
  crossroads, and onto Aghnatrisk Road, which again is 1 mile long. At this
  crossroads turn right – past houses and a Methodist church. Once over the
  motorway bridge the Church is on the left – in total it's just over 3 miles
  from Sprucefield."

The aim of our assembly is to encourage Bible teachers and Bible sharers to give themselves to the indispensable work of presenting the Lord Jesus Christ to believers and unbelievers, to all ages, and to all kinds of people. We, therefore, seek to help those engaged in preaching and teaching to see the expounding of Scripture as the pressing need in today's church and to equip them in the exacting work involved in such a ministry. While the assembly, therefore, is mainly for those in full-time preaching ministries, others are welcome, especially students, interns, and spouses of Christian workers.

In the prologue to his Gospel the apostle John writes of how ‘the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.’ It is the first of many references in the Gospel to ‘glory’ and, in particular, to the glory of Jesus. This ‘glory’ is the same ‘glory’, as John tells us, that Isaiah witnessed in the temple and spoke about in his writings.

‘Beholding the Glory of Jesus in John’s Gospel’ is the theme which Joe Barnard and Andy Prime will unpack for us in this year’s Ministry Assembly. 
In ‘The Supremacy of God in Preaching’ John Piper writes that ‘it is not the job of the Christian preacher to give moral or psychological pep talks about how to get along in the world; someone else can do that. But most of our people have no one in the world to tell them week in, week out, about the supreme beauty and majesty of God.’

The essence of this, as Paul puts it in 2 Corinthians 4, is to preach Jesus Christ in such a way that those who sit under our ministries are given, through the Holy Spirit, ‘the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.’

Booking will open towards the end of August.

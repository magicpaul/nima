### The Third Northern Ireland Ministry Assembly

The aim of our annual assembly is to encourage preachers. We firmly believe that when the Bible is opened and taught faithfully and relevantly the voice of God is heard in a living and powerful way. We therefore seek to encourage those engaged in preaching to see the exacting work of expounding Scripture as the pressing need in today's church. While the assembly, therefore, is mainly for those in current full-time preaching ministries, others are very welcome, especially students, apprentices and spouses of Christian workers.

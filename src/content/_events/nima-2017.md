directions: "How to get there: From the M1 take the Sprucefield exit and follow
  the signs for Hillsborough/Dublin/Newry onto the A1 dual carriageway. After 1
  mile and at the top of the hill you will see a sign pointing right for
  Culcavy. This road is Harrys Road. Travel for 1 mile, go straight across the
  crossroads, and onto Aghnatrisk Road, which again is 1 mile long. At this
  crossroads turn right – past houses and a Methodist church. Once over the
  motorway bridge the Church is on the left – in total it's just over 3 miles
  from Sprucefield."

The aim of our annual assembly is to encourage preachers. We firmly believe that when the Bible is opened and taught faithfully and relevantly the voice of God is heard in a living and powerful way. We therefore seek to encourage those engaged in preaching to see the exacting work of expounding Scripture as the pressing need in today's church. While the assembly, therefore, is mainly for those in current full-time preaching ministries, others are very welcome, especially students, apprentices and spouses of Christian workers.

In light of our increasingly tumultuous society and world, we look forward to taking time to look at Suffering and the Sovereignty of God in the Psalms of David and Life of Joseph. Christopher and Colin will seek to encourage and challenge us as we seek to reconcile our individual and global suffering with the Sovereignty of God in all situations. Come along to be fed, encouraged, challenged and strengthened in the Word of God.

We are delighted to have Dr. Conrad Mbewe joining us for our Preaching Day on Tuesday, 17 May, 2022

Conrad was to speak at NIMA 2020 which, unfortunately, we had to cancel and so we are especially glad to have him come to our Preaching Day where he will help us understand and teach the message of Colossians.

The Preaching Day will be held in the T3 Conference Centre at the House of Vic-Ryn, Moira Road, Lisburn from 10.00 a.m. to 4.00 p.m. and will include four teaching sessions on Paul’s letter to the Colossians.

Booking will close on 10 May.
